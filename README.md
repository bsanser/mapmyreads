- 🔗 **Shareable Links**: Share your reading map with friends (24-hour expiry)
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Works beautifully on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- 🎨 **Multiple Themes**: Choose from different map themes
- 💬 **Feedback System**: Easy feedback collection without login
- ☕ **Support**: Buy me a coffee to support the project

## Data Storage Strategy

### Current Implementation (No Login Required)

The application uses a **session-based storage strategy** that allows users to:

1. **Upload and Process**: Users upload their CSV files which are processed client-side
2. **Session Storage**: Processed book data is stored in browser sessionStorage with a unique session ID
3. **Shareable URLs**: Users can generate shareable links that encode their reading data
4. **Temporary Storage**: Sessions expire after 24 hours for privacy and storage management

### Storage Components

- **`lib/storage.ts`**: Core storage utilities for session management
- **`types/book.ts`**: TypeScript interfaces for book data
- **`components/ShareButton.tsx`**: URL generation and sharing functionality
- **`components/FeedbackButton.tsx`**: Feedback collection system

### Future Implementation (With User Accounts)

When users create accounts, the system will:

1. **Database Storage**: Migrate session data to persistent database storage
2. **User Profiles**: Store user information and reading history
3. **Enhanced Features**: Reading statistics, book recommendations, social features
4. **Data Migration**: Seamless transition from session to account-based storage

### Database Schema

The `prisma/schema.prisma` file defines the future database structure:

- **Users**: User accounts and profiles
- **Books**: Individual book records with geographic data
- **Sessions**: Temporary session storage for sharing
- **Feedback**: User feedback and feature requests

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Upload Your Reading List**:
   - Export your library from [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/import) or [StoryGraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/user-export)
   - Upload the CSV file to see your reading map

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Maps**: React Simple Maps with D3
- **CSV Parsing**: PapaParse
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma (future)

## Privacy & Data

- **No Login Required**: Users can use the app without creating accounts
- **Client-Side Processing**: CSV files are processed entirely in the browser
- **Temporary Storage**: Session data expires after 24 hours
- **No Data Collection**: User data is not stored on servers unless explicitly shared
